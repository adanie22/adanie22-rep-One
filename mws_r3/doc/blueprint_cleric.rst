Roffes' export utility
----------------------

For export, transform and import refer also to C. Roffe and J. Betancur shell/perl scripts.

Differences to :ref:`cdc.etl <CDC etl>`:

* below scripts run interactively, CDC etl is batch mode
* accordingly, CDC Etl requires stack ID's, asset paths to be given in load_settings.json
